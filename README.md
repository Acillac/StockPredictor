# Monte Carlo Stock Price Predictor

Project

Created a stock predictor that searches up the history of a certain stock. I used the adjusted close and based off the percentage changes in each trading day, I created a normal distribution chart that plots future prices a certain amount of days into the future. Using this information, I can find the mean and varying confidence intervals that each user inputs.
